            <h2>Leveraging Magic School AI for Scientific Learning</h2>
            
            <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 25px;">Magic School AI offers powerful tools to <strong>generate inquiry-based lesson plans, create differentiated learning materials, and design assessments that focus on scientific practices</strong>. Both teacher-facing tools and the MagicStudent platform help streamline your planning while creating engaging, interactive experiences for your students.</p>
            
            <div class="tool-card">
                <h4>Two Ways to Access Magic School AI for Science Education</h4>
                
                <h5 style="color: #e65100; margin-top: 20px;">Option 1: Magic School Teacher Tools</h5>
                <p>Access pre-built generators designed for specific educational tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>5E Model Lesson Plan Generator</strong>: Creates complete inquiry-based science units</li>
                    <li><strong>Science Labs Generator</strong>: Designs hands-on investigations</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Table Analysis Generator</strong>: Creates realistic datasets for analysis practice</li>
                    <li><strong>DOK Question Generator</strong>: Develops higher-level thinking questions</li>
                    <li><strong>Rubric Generator</strong>: Assesses scientific practices and skills</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Based Learning Tool</strong>: Designs extended scientific investigations</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Best for: Structured lesson planning with specific educational frameworks</em></p>

                <h5 style="color: #e65100; margin-top: 20px;">Option 2: Raina Chatbot</h5>
                <p>Have natural conversations with Magic School's AI assistant to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Brainstorm Ideas</strong>: "Raina, I need creative ways to teach states of matter to 2nd graders"</li>
                    <li><strong>Modify Existing Lessons</strong>: "Can you help me adapt this lesson for students with special needs?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Troubleshoot Problems</strong>: "My students aren't understanding fair testing - what are some concrete examples I could use?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Get Quick Answers</strong>: "What are some safe materials 4th graders can use to test electrical conductivity?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan Differentiation</strong>: "How can I make this investigation accessible for English language learners?"</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Best for: Flexible problem-solving and personalized teaching support</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="ai-tip">
                <h4>Choosing Between Tools and Raina</h4>
                <p><strong>Use Teacher Tools when:</strong> You want structured output in a specific format (lesson plans, rubrics, data tables)</p>
                <p><strong>Use Raina when:</strong> You want to brainstorm, modify existing content, or need flexible teaching advice</p>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Many teachers use both! Start with Teacher Tools to create base materials, then chat with Raina to customize and improve them.</p>

                <h3>How Magic School AI Develops Students as Scientists</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inquiry-Based Learning Design</strong>: Generate complete lesson plans that lead students through authentic scientific investigations</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis Practice</strong>: Create realistic datasets for students to analyze and draw conclusions from</li>
                    <li><strong>Differentiated Materials</strong>: Automatically adjust content complexity for different learners</li>
                    <li><strong>Assessment Innovation</strong>: Design rubrics that focus on scientific practices rather than just content recall</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher-Order Thinking</strong>: Generate questions that push students beyond memorization to true scientific reasoning</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="ai-tip">
                <h4>AI Teaching Tip</h4>
                <p>Magic School AI is most effective when you provide specific, detailed prompts. Instead of asking for "a science lesson," specify the grade level, topic, scientific practice focus, and desired activities.</p>
